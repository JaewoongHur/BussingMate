# BussingMate
BussingMate is an integrated robotics system that enables a robot to automatically clean and set tables in restaurant environments.
It combines ROS2, YOLO-based perception, reinforcement learning for motion/decision policies, LLM-based voice command parsing, and a real-time React/Vite GUI.
